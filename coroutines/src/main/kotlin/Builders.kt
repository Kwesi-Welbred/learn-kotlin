/**
 * Coroutines builders: launch async and runBlocking
 * The launch coroutines builder launches a new coroutines without blocking the current thread. It inherit the its immediate
 * parent thread and returns a job object.
 *
 * GlobalScope coroutines are top-level coroutines and can survive the entire life of the application
 * unlike the local launch function where is alive on an active launch.
 *when do we use global and local coroutines: we create global coroutine when operation of one activity
 * wouldn't affect or depend on the operation of the other activity. eg...file downloading, music play etc.
 * we also use the local launch only when there is dependant operations. such as screen navs and simple calcs
